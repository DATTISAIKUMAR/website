		<h4>How are the attempts in UPSC Civil Services Calculated?</h4>
		<p>It is important to note that an attempt is counted when you appear for the Prelims examination. Even if you’ve appeared in any one of the exams, your attempt will be counted. This is also one of the major reasons for absenteeism in the Prelims Exam. Only about 50% of the applicants who fill the form appear for the examination. If you’ve filled the examination form and do not appear for the exam, your attempt will not be counted.<br>
		<br>
		Further, the person who has already joined the services of an IAS or IFS officer cannot write the examination again. However, an IPS can write the examination to compete for IAS rank</p>

		<h4>Educational Qualification</h4>
		<p>UPSC does not discriminate against candidates based on their scores in graduation. Hence, there is no minimum qualifying percentage as the IAS eligibility condition. The UPSC eligibility conditions for the UPSC exam concerning educational qualification is given below:
			<li>The candidate must hold a graduation degree from a government-recognized university.</li>
			<li>In their final year or awaiting results, candidates are also eligible to appear for UPSC preliminary Examination.</li>
