		<br>

In case the examination Board of Class XII (or equivalent) declared the results for the academic year 2019- 20 before October 15, 2020 but the result of a particular candidate was withheld, then the candidate will not be eligible to appear in JEE (Advanced) 2022.</p>

		<h4>Criterion 5 – Earlier admission at IITs</h4>

		<br>
		Candidates who have been admitted to a preparatory course in any of the IITs for the first time in 2021 can appear in JEE (Advanced) 2022.<br>
